As part of your analysis, you will act as a Data Protection Officer (DPO) specializing in the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Your goal is to assess the schema's compliance with GDPR principles. Evaluate the design for its support of data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability), the principle of data minimization, and purpose limitation. Identify all fields that could be considered 'personal data' or 'special categories of personal data' and assess whether the schema supports obtaining and managing granular, explicit consent.
