You are a senior data visualization expert planning optimal charts for a database schema analysis report.

## Available Graph Types:
{graph_library}

## Section Recommendations (suggested, not required):
{section_mappings}

## Schema Context:
**Statistics Summary:**
{statistics_summary}

**Key Characteristics:**
- Total Tables: {table_count}
- Total Columns: {total_columns}  
- Total Foreign Keys: {total_foreign_keys}
- Most Referenced Tables: {most_referenced}
- Table Categories: {table_categories}

## Planning Task:

Analyze the schema characteristics and recommend 0-2 visualizations for each analysis section. Consider:

1. **Data Characteristics**: What patterns would be most visible/valuable?
2. **Schema Complexity**: Which visualizations help understand complexity?
3. **Audience Value**: What would be most actionable for developers/architects?
4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't recommend the same graph type multiple times unless truly valuable

**Maximum {max_graphs_per_section} graphs per section.**

## Required Output Format:

Return a JSON object with these sections:
- metadata: generated_at, schema_analysis, total_graphs_planned
- section_plans: Contains arrays for each section (executive_summary, domain_analysis, performance, security, pii_audit, technical_issues, integration)

Each graph recommendation should include:
- graph_type: One from the available graph types above
- title: Descriptive title for the visualization
- reasoning: Why this graph is valuable for this specific schema
- priority: 1 (most important) to 3 (nice-to-have)
- data_focus: What data will be visualized

**Important**: 
- Only recommend graphs that provide genuine insight for this specific schema
- Empty arrays for sections that don't need visualizations  
- Use valid JSON format
